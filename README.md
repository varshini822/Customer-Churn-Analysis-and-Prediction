# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction
ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes and predicts customer churn in a telecommunications company. The aim is to identify at-risk customers, discover churn patterns, and build predictive models to support better retention strategies.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn, xgboost

Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

ðŸš€ Workflow ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Scaled numerical features

ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Calculated churn rate

Visualized demographics, billing info, and contract types

Checked correlations with churn

ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Customer Segmentation

Segmented customers by tenure, monthly charges, and service calls

Compared churn across groups

ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Predictive Modeling

Built Logistic Regression model (baseline)

Evaluated with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Visualized feature importance

ðŸ“Š Key Insights

Month-to-month customers are more likely to churn.

Higher customer service calls indicate higher churn risk.

Logistic Regression provided interpretable results, while other models (Random Forest, XGBoost) can be tried for improved accuracy.
